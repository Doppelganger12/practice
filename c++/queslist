ques1: Maximium the elements with a[i+1] > a[i] in array possible
ques2: Program for array rotation
ques3: Reversal algorithm for array rotation
ques4: binary Search an element in a sorted and rotated array
ques5:Given a sorted and rotated array, find if there is a pair with a given sum in O(N)
ques6:Find maximum value of Sum( i*arr[i]) with only rotations on given array allowed
ques8:Given a matrix of N * M. Find the maximum path sum in matrix. The maximum path is sum of all elements from first row to last row where you are allowed to move only down or diagonally to left or right. You can start from any element in first row.
